    "text": "The purpose of this book is to make a brief demonstration of the pins package using R and Python, and to imagine how it might be used with JavaScript.\nPins helps you manage sharing data with yourself, others, or even CI processes. There are two levels of abstraction:\n\npin: a “thing” to be shared as a file. It could be a data frame, a model, a nested list (dictionary, object). If it can be serialized to a file, it can be pinned. Some serializations, such as CSV, JSON, and arrow, are common to multiple languages (R, Python, JavaScript), so can be used for cross-language collaboration. Other serializations are specific to a language (pickle for Python, rds for R).\nboard: a collection of pins hosted at a “place”. A board could be hosted at Azure Blob Storage, an Amazon S3 Bucket, RStudio (soon to be Posit) Connect, a local filesystem, a remote URL, …\n\nPins distinguishes itself from straightforward filesharing by:\n\nstoring metadata, including user-defined metadata.\nthis metadata allows pins to handle deserialization automatically.\nsupporting versioning.\nsupporting authentication for boards (e.g. AWS S3).\ncaching results locally, so that reading a pin may not require a download.\n\n\n\nIn the rest of the book I (plan to):\n\nuse R to:\n\ncreate a board.\nwrite a data frame as a pin, using the arrow format.\nread the pin into a data frame.\n\nuse Python to:\n\nread the data-frame pin written using R.\nwrite a pandas data-frame as a pin using the arrow format.\n\nuse JavaScript to:\n\nread the data-frame pins written using R and Python, using arquero, which supports the arrow format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto implementation\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time a pin is written, a new file is created on the board; this supports versioning. I don’t want to write a new version of the same file each time this book is rendered (especially on CI).\nTo avoid this, for code-blocks where I write pins:\n\nI include code that I run only manually.\nI paste the response into the prose manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have some ideas for the conculsions I might come to in the course of writing the rest of this material. That said, I’ll want to make some actual observations before calling for any action. I’ll update this section as I go."

    "text": "1.1 Local board\nThe first step is to create a board:\n\nboard_here <- board_folder(here(\"pins\"), versioned = FALSE)\n\n\n1.1.1 Writing pins\nThe next step is to write a pin. Let’s write the penguins data-frame as a JSON pin:\n\npin_write(\n  board_here, \n  x = penguins, \n  name = \"penguins-json\", \n  type = \"json\",\n  metadata = list(\n    authors = c(\"Allison Horst\", \"Alison Hill\", \"Kristen Gorman\"),\n    license = \"CCO\",\n    url = \"https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\"\n  ),\n  versioned = FALSE\n)\n\nCreating new version '20220805T171936Z-fa33e'\nWriting to pin 'penguins-json'\nAnd as a CSV file:\n\npin_write(\n  board_here, \n  x = penguins, \n  name = \"penguins-csv\", \n  type = \"csv\",\n  metadata = list(\n    authors = c(\"Allison Horst\", \"Alison Hill\", \"Kristen Gorman\"),\n    license = \"CCO\",\n    url = \"https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\"\n  ),\n  versioned = FALSE\n)\n\nCreating new version '20220807T212556Z-809e9'\nWriting to pin 'penguins-csv'\nAs you can see, the version number is a combination of the creation time (UTC) and a (shortened) hash of the contents.\nI also want to create an arrow version of the pin.\nThe pin_write() function offers type = \"arrow\", which uses arrow::write_feather(). However, the default behavior is to use compression; pins does not offer (so far as I know) a way to supply the compression argument to arrow::write_feather(). This presents a problem for me because the arrow implementation for JavaScript does not support compression.\nIt should not surprise you that pins offers an escape hatch, I can wrap pins_upload() in a function:\n\npin_write_arrow_uncompressed <- function(board, x, name = NULL, ...) {\n  \n  tempfile <- withr::local_tempfile()\n  \n  arrow::write_feather(x, tempfile, compression = \"uncompressed\")\n  \n  result <- pins::pin_upload(\n    board,\n    paths = tempfile,\n    name = name,\n    ...\n  )\n  \n  message(glue::glue(\"Writing to pin '{name}'\"))\n  \n  invisible(result)\n}\n\n\npin_write_arrow_uncompressed(\n  board_here, \n  x = penguins, \n  name = \"penguins-arrow\", \n  metadata = list(\n    authors = c(\"Allison Horst\", \"Alison Hill\", \"Kristen Gorman\"),\n    license = \"CCO\",\n    url = \"https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\"\n  )\n)\n\nCreating new version '20220805T175034Z-ef034'\nWriting to pin 'penguins-arrow'\n\n\n1.1.2 Reading pins\n\npenguins_json <- pin_read(board_here, name = \"penguins-json\")\ncompare(penguins, penguins_json)\n\n`class(old)`: \"tbl_df\" \"tbl\" \"data.frame\"\n`class(new)`:                \"data.frame\"\n\n`old$species` is an S3 object of class <factor>, an integer vector\n`new$species` is a character vector ('Adelie', 'Adelie', 'Adelie', 'Adelie', 'Adelie', ...)\n\n`old$island` is an S3 object of class <factor>, an integer vector\n`new$island` is a character vector ('Torgersen', 'Torgersen', 'Torgersen', 'Torgersen', 'Torgersen', ...)\n\n`old$sex` is an S3 object of class <factor>, an integer vector\n`new$sex` is a character vector ('male', 'female', 'female', NA, 'female', ...)\n\n\nWe see some differences between the original (“old”) version and “new” version of penguins:\n\nnew version does not have the “tibble” classes.\nnew version does not know that some of the colunms are factors.\n\nThese are not huge differences; in fact, the JSON format has no way of encoding that something is a factor.\nLet’s look at the arrow version. Because we used a file format (using pin_upload()), we need also to write a handler for pin_download():\n\npin_read_arrow_uncompressed <- function(board, name, ...) {\n  \n  tempfile <- pins::pin_download(board, name, ...)\n  \n  arrow::read_feather(tempfile)\n}\n\n\npenguins_arrow <- pin_read_arrow_uncompressed(board_here, \"penguins-arrow\")\ncompare(penguins, penguins_arrow)\n\n✔ No differences\n\n\nThe fact that there are no differences is one of the many cool things about arrow.\n\n\n1.1.3 Deploying pins\nTo make it easier to deploy a board on GitHub (or any other web server), I am using the experimental pinsManifest package to create a manifest of pins. This file, pins.txt is written to the board’s root directory; it will make it easier to create a board_url() to read pins.\n\npin_write_manifest(board_here)"
