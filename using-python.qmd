# Using Python

For this chapter, I will use Python via R's reticulate package.
All code blocks that do not use Python will have a comment at the top, just like this one which uses R:


```{r}
# r
library("reticulate")
use_virtualenv("renv/python/virtualenvs/renv-python-3.10")
```

```{python}
from pins import board_folder, board_urls
```

```{python}
board_here = board_folder("pins")
```
